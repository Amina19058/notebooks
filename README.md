# [Notebooks](http://mybinder.org/repo/Naereen/notebooks) by [Naereen @ GitHub](https://naereen.github.io/)

This repository hosts some [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), covering various subject.

- Some are tutorials on bash commands or some of [command-line my scripts](https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/bin/src/master/);
- Some are experiments, only here to help me learn how to use [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) correctly;
- And more will come...
