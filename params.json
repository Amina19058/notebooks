View the notebooks statically\r\n- Either directly in GitHub: [see the list of notebooks](https://github.com/Naereen/notebooks/search?l=jupyter-notebook);\r\n- Or on [nbviewer.jupiter.org](http://nbviewer.jupiter.org/): [list of notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Naereen/notebooks/).\r\n\r\n### 1.b. Play with the notebooks dynamically\r\n[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/Naereen/notebooks)\r\n\r\nAnyone can use the [mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org/) website (by [clicking](http://mybinder.org/repo/Naereen/notebooks) on the icon above) to run the notebook in her/his web-browser.\r\nYou can then play with it as long as you like, for instance by modifying the values or experimenting with the code.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## 2. *Requirements to run the notebooks locally*?\r\nAll [the requirements](requirements.txt) can be installed with [``pip``](https://pip.readthedocs.io/) and by running a few ``python -m ...`` commands.\r\n\r\n> Note: if you use [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/) instead of [Python 2](https://docs.python.org/2/), you might have to *replace* ``pip`` and ``python`` by ``pip3`` and ``python3`` in the next commands.\r\n\r\n### 2.a. [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) and [IPython](http://ipython.org/)\r\n```bash\r\nsudo pip install jupyter ipython\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will also install all the dependencies, afterward you should have a ``jupyter-notebook`` command (or a ``jupyter`` command, to be ran as ``jupyter notebook``) available in your ``PATH``:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ whereis jupyter-notebook\r\njupyter-notebook: /usr/local/bin/jupyter-notebook\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2.b. Other kernels:\r\n> They are only needed to run the notebooks written for Bash or Octave (or OCaml):\r\n\r\n#### 2.b.1. [GNU Bash kernel](https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel)\r\n- You have to have [``bash``](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) installed ([already there](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html) on all Linux distribution, installable with [``brew``](http://brew.sh/) or [``macports``](https://www.macports.org/) on Mac OS, available on Windows through [``cygwin``](http://cygwin.org/)):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ bash --version | head -n1\r\nGNU bash, version 4.3.42(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- And then install the kernel ``bash_kernel`` with these two commands:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo pip install bash_kernel\r\npython -m bash_kernel.install\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 2.b.2. [GNU Octave kernel](https://github.com/calysto/octave_kernel)\r\n- You have to have [``octave``](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) installed (installable with the package manager on major Linux distributions (``apt-get``, ``pacman``, ``yum`` etc), installable with [``brew``](http://brew.sh/) or [``macports``](https://www.macports.org/) on Mac OS, available on Windows through [``cygwin``](http://cygwin.org/) or [natively](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/windows/)):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ octave --version | head -n1\r\nGNU Octave, version 4.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Your version of Octave should be installed with [gnuplot]() support (it is usually the case):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ gnuplot --version | head -n1\r\ngnuplot 5.0 patchlevel 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n- And then install the kernel ``bash_kernel`` with these two commands:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo pip install octave_kernel\r\npython -m octave_kernel.install\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### More information?\r\n> - More information about [notebooks (on the documentation of IPython)](http://nbviewer.jupiter.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/3.x/examples/Notebook/Index.ipynb) or [on the FAQ on Jupyter's website](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/faq).\r\n> - More information about [mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org/): on [this example repository](https://github.com/binder-project/example-requirements).\r\n\r\n### License\r\nAll the notebooks in this repository are published under the terms of the [MIT license](http://lbesson.mit-license.org/) (file [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt)).\r\n\r\n[![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-38514290-17/github.com/Naereen/notebooks/README.md?pixel)](https://github.com/Naereen/notebooks/)\r\n",
